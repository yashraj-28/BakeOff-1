## Bake-Off 1: Pointing

Legal Ideas:

	1.	Flashing the square red (instead of the cyan color now) so that it grabs more attention.
	2.	Draw a line from the centre of the highlighted square to the position of the mouse cursor, indicating the user the shortest path.
	3.	Playing sound feedback when a square is highlighted.
	4.	Playing sound feedback when the user clicks on the square correctly or incorrectly.
	5.	Make all others squares (except for the highlighted one) slightly dim so that they are less visible.
	6.	Changing the cursor, when it hovers over the highlighted square
	1.	Increasing the screen space for greater freedom of movement.
