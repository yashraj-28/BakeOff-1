## Bakeoff 1: Pointing

### Initial Ideas:

1. Make highlight color Red. 
2. Flash a square (between Red and White) when highlighted. 
3. Reduce visibility of un-highlighted squares. 
4. Draw a line from center of the highlighted square to the cursor.
5. Remove the mouse and make cursor color Cyan.
6. Shrink cursor when it hovers over the highlighted square.
7. Play sound feedback when a square is highlighted.
8. Play sound feedback on hit/ miss.


### Prototype 1:

    Ideas implemented: 1-5

### First Refinement:
- Modifications for better contrast
    - Make the cursor bright green instead of Cyan. 
    - Remove the black stroke around cursor.
    - Increase stroke weight.
- Keep all the other ideas.
